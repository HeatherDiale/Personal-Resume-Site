# Personal-Resume-Site
Get to know a little more about me on my personal projects sites, where I display my talents and passions, such as: artwork, writing, webdesign, and print design. 
I'm always getting into something, I'm just simply not one to sit still for long, so over the years I've acquired a collection that's filled with little parts of my personality. 

While this site is still very much a work in progress, I'm excited to watch it continue to grow with new persuits.
